I am a data engineering/analysis professional turned Ruby on Rails developer, looking for an opportunity to contribute to a team and further "develop" my skill set, so to speak.

<figure class="lineno-container">
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
allie_career.skills = {
  data_analysis: {
    tableau: 150,
    excel: 150,
    data_vis: 150
    },
  data_engineering: {
    sql: 75,
    dimensional_modeling: 50
    },
  salesforce: 100,
  management: 100
}

def bootcamp_level_up!
  self.skills[ruby_knowledge] = 100
  self.skills[rails_knowledge] = 100
  self.skills[html_css_knowledge] = 50
  self.skills[javascript_knowledge] = 50
end
{% endhighlight %}
